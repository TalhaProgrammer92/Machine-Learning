# Types of Machine Learning

There are *four main types of machine learning*, each with different learning strategies based on data and feedback. Here's a breakdown:

---

### **1. Supervised Learning**
- **Description**: The model learns from a labeled dataset (data with input-output pairs).
- **Key Points**:
  - Requires a **teacher** (training data with known outputs).
  - The goal is **prediction** – the model learns to predict the output from input data.
  - Examples: Spam detection, housing price prediction, image classification.
  
---

### **2. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)**
- **Description**: The model works with **unlabeled data** and tries to find hidden patterns or groupings.
- **Key Points**:
  - No teacher or predefined outcomes.
  - **Self-learning** – the model finds **structure or clusters** in data.
  - Examples: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, topic modeling.

### **3. Semi-Supervised Learning**
- **Description**: A hybrid approach using both **labeled and unlabeled** data.
- **Key Points**:
  - A small portion of data is labeled, while the majority is not.
  - Combines the strengths of supervised and unsupervised learning.
  - Example: Medical image diagnosis where only a few scans are labeled by doctors.

### **4. Reinforcement Learning**
- **Description**: The model learns through **trial and error** by interacting with an environment.
- **Key Points**:
  - Based on **feedback** (rewards or punishments).
  - Learns to make decisions to maximize **cumulative rewards** over time.
  - Examples: Game-playing AI (like AlphaGo), robotics, self-driving cars.
