# What is Machine Learning (ML)?
- As the name suggests, ML allows you to learn and make decisions smartly.
- In ML, machines can learn from the data provided or their own experience. It depends upon the type of ML model.

# Machine Learning Life Cycle

The machine learning lifecycle is a structured process that data scientists and machine learning engineers follow to build, deploy, and maintain machine learning systems. Here's a brief overview of the key stages:

## 1. Data Gathering: 
Identifying and collecting relevant data from various sources.

## 2. Data Preparation: 
Cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming the raw data into a suitable format for modeling. This includes handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

## 3. Model Selection: 
Choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithm or model based on the problem type, data characteristics, and desired1 outcome.

## 4. Model Training: 
Feeding the prepared data to the selected model to learn patterns and relationships. This involves tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

## 5. Model Evaluation: 
Assessing the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics on unseen data to ensure it generalizes well.

## 6. Deployment: 
Integrating the trained and evaluated model into a production environment where it can be used to make predictions or decisions.

## 7. Monitoring and Maintenance: 
Continuously tracking the model's performance in the real world and retraining or updating it as needed to maintain accuracy and address concept drift.
